## Homework 1 (05.11.2021)

[Here](files/homework1.html) is Gesture Recognition and Time Series Representation. In this homework, a multivariate time series data is tried to be visualized and understood. The data is a motion data expressed in three dimension: X,Y,Z. This data is actually for efficient personalized gesture recognition on wide range of devices. In this homework, the aim is only to make some manipulations on data and try to anticipate which class belongs to which gesture and after that finding representations to this time series.

## Homework 2 (22.11.2021)

[Here](files/homework2.html) you can find the second homework. The main goal is to represent the time series with alternative approaches and these 2 penalized versions of the linear regression approaches that "1D Fused Lasso" and "Regression Trees" are alternative ways to obtain adaptive piecewise constant approximation. After having the representations, their ability of representation and classification performance will be evaluated at the end.

## Homework 4 (23.01.2021)

[Here](files/homework4.html) you can find the fourth homework. In this forecasting problem, the aim is to find a model providing hourly solar power prediction for the next day. This prediction is needed in the following setting. Suppose that you are at day d and the predictions are needed for the day d+1 and you know the production values until the end of d-1. The proposed model is using the regression tree-based approach.
